Delta making a case for bridge.
Municipality hoping to convince new provincial government to continue with project
Delta is making a well-documented pitch to the leaders of the next provincial government not to kill the George Massey Tunnel Replacement Project.
Municipal officials have compiled an extensive volume of reports illustrating the need for the bridge and highlighting how it's the most economically and environmentally feasible option.
The Delta report will be sent to all BC MLAs as well as some federal and municipal politicians and other stakeholders.
Delta staff members have pulled everything together in the particular hope of convincing soon to be NDP Premier John Horgan and Green Leader Andrew Weaver to support the $3.5-billion project that has already begun construction.
Wondering how an environmental scientist like Weaver would prefer a more impactful, and expensive, second tunnel instead of a bridge, Mayor Lois Jackson said she's hoping a Delta delegation will be able to meet with the leaders.
Horgan hasn't stated opposition to the project but has said he'd defer the matter to the region's mayors. It's a sore point for Jackson as the other mayors have voiced opposition to the bridge, something Delta's veteran mayor said is merely politics because they'd like the money for their own projects.
She said it's been nothing but frustration to hear false statements, including claims the project hasn't been properly reviewed.
