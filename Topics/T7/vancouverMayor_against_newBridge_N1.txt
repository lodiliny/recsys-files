Vancouver's mayor maintains position against Massey Replacement Bridge
As chair of the Metro Vancouver TransLink Mayors’ Council, Mayor Gregor Robertson has consistently maintained the multi billion-dollar project is too costly and will only serve to increase congestion in our region.
Despite a new report released this week by Delta municipal staff pushing for the project to continue, he is not changing his views on the project.
“We have real concerns about the impacts in Richmond and Vancouver of cars just piling up basically when they hit the city streets,” says Robertson. “That will be a major problem and it’s billions and billions of dollars for infrastructure that could better be deployed to accelerate the work on the Pattullo Bridge.”
As for Delta, the municipality’s chief administrative officer George Harvie says the Metro mayors are taking this stance based on politics, not evidence.
“The bridge is the best answer, according to the experts,” says Harvie. “We listen to the experts, we don’t listen to the politicians, the experts are saying the bridge is the best way to go.”
