BC’s Minister of Transportation is pitching plans for a $3.5-billion, 10-lane toll bridge, as the answer to concerns from first responders about the George Massey Tunnel.
A recent report to Delta council details instances where emergency vehicles couldn’t get close enough to a crash site and responders had to walk in.
Delta Police spokeswoman Sharlene Brooks says there have been challenging calls due to congestion blocking access to the tunnel.
“In the tunnel, there is obviously a confined space, which creates some health and safety concerns.
There is limited access.
We have had first responders have to carry equipment into the tunnel because of the congestion,” she says.
Brooks says the concern is not just for life and death situations, but also for general road safety for the approximately 80,000 drivers who travel the Richmond-Delta corridor.
In a written statement, Transportation Minister Todd Stone estimates a new bridge over the Fraser River to replace the tunnel and upgrades to Highway 99 would drop collision numbers by 35 per cent.
“Their recent report to council highlights one of the main reasons we’re moving ahead with the replacement of the tunnel – the safety of the travelling public who use this crossing every day.”
The improvements to Highway 99 and the construction of the bridge are expected to take approximately 5 years to complete.
“The new bridge to replace the George Massey Tunnel will be safer for motorists, safer and more accessible for first responders, and safer in the motorists, safer and more accessible for first responders, and safer in the event of an earthquake.
And that’s why we’re moving ahead with this important project,” Stone says.
