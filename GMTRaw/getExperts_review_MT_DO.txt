Get global experts to review tunnel.
The report on the George Massey Tunnel Replacement Project issued by Mayor Lois Jackson and CAO George Harvie needs to be answered.
They cherry picked their so-called facts from old reports that were jerry rigged to substantiate the provincial Liberal government and the Port of Vancouver condemnation and removal of the George Massey Tunnel, and accommodate the industrialization of the lower Fraser River.
If one is to believe the misleading information about the condition and the safety of the George Massey Tunnel, it should be closed immediately.
Why have the hundreds of immersed tunnels around the world that are much older than the George Massey Tunnel not been decommissioned? My suggestion is that the new provincial NDP government ignore the Delta report and request Tunnel Engineering Consultants, one the world's top experts in immersed tunnel construction, to review the condition and life of the George Massey Tunnel and suggest what improvements could be made immediately to make it safe and usable for many years to come.
Tunnel Engineering Consultants from Rotterdam should also be asked to determine the feasibility and cost of a second tunnel upriver from the present George Massey Tunnel.
We must not allow the manipulation of the facts to destroy a perfectly good crossing when there are better solutions that would cost less money and be less destructive to the very environment in which any additional new crossing would be built.
