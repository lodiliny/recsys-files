Metro Vancouver to ask BC NDP government about status of bridge replacement for George Massey Tunnel.
John Horgan may soon have to cross the bridge about his intentions regarding the George Massey Tunnel.
The B.C. NDP premier had previously indicated that he will defer to the mayors of Metro Vancouver.
Except for Delta Mayor Lois Jackson, mayors in the Lower Mainland are opposed to the replacement of the tunnel with a new 10-lane toll bridge linking Richmond and Delta.
Horgan had also said that he will take advice from the staff of the ministry of transportation, and look at all options.
The premier hasn’t said that his newly installed government will ditch the bridge project estimated to cost taxpayers at least $3.5 billion.
Construction activities have started last spring, and based on previous projections, it is expected to be completed in 2022.
Horgan and his government will likely hear soon from mayors and councillors comprising the board of the Metro Vancouver regional government.
The Metro Vancouver board is expected to approve Friday (July 28) a recommendation to write the provincial government to inquire about the status of the George Massey Tunnel replacement project.
The letter is also anticipated to express the board’s wish to work with the province and other stakeholders to explore alternatives to the 10-lane bridge.
Last Monday (July 24), Richmond council voted to ask Horgan to consider twinning the tunnel as an option.
The bridge plan was approved by the B.C. Liberal government in 2013. 
In June last year, the Metro Vancouver board decided not to support the bridge project because of its potential impacts, which include the opening of more agricultural lands for residential and commercial development.
